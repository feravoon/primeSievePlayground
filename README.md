# primeSievePlayground
I try prime sieve algorithms in different programming languages.  
(Inspired by [davepl](https://github.com/davepl)'s [Primes](https://github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/Primes) project. But the codes are neither in the style of nor compatible with it.)

### TO-DO
- Add result validation to Java, C#, Go and Rust codes
- I now check all the primes up to 1 million for validation. I can also check the number of primes below certain numbers. (like in [Primes](https://github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/Primes))
